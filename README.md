# grow-swapi

This project was a code challenge given to me by Grow.com.  The instructions for the challenge are included as [instructions.md](instructions.md).

This is posted here not as a finished product, nor to help other's cheat and find my solution.  I am posting this here as an example of my current coding skills.

This project took me 3 hours to code, beginning to end.
